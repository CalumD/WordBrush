# WordBrush
This project takes ASCII input and draws the resultant line, as if you were to 'swipe-to-type' that word across a touchscreen keyboard.


# Notes to be removed before project completion:
 - In the case of words like 'was' and 'lol', which are fully contained in the extremities of the width of a 'keyboard',
 do we want to centre and trim the word in the file output?
    - This would result in more natural output of the word in written-form language
    - This would cause the output image width to be non-standard
